# ebuilds (samurai version)
## BIG FAT UGLY WARNING
This is my attempt to port as many of the ebuilds that I use (which utilize `ninja.build`) from `dev-util/ninja` to `dev-util/samurai`
as possible. I make absolutely **NO GUARANTEE** that the ebuilds in this branch will even build for you (unless you're
using a `~amd64` install that is absolutely tip-top up to date).
On top of that, until this current university semester ends in mid-December, this branch will be functionally unsupported
and **EXPERIMENTAL ONLY**.
## CONTRIBUTING
That being said, I _will_ accept bug reports and PRs against the repository, so long as you can either (a) provide a clear
description of your build problem _and_ logs and `portage` environment info for the failed build, or (b) patches to a
packages `ebuild` or `ninja.build` file as necessary. However, until I finish this semester, my response times will probably
be sluggish at best.
